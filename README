///////WHAT THE CODE DOES//////

The first step to create a database called 'toydatabase' with 5 tables:
+-----------------------+
| Tables_in_toydatabase |
+-----------------------+
| clientCommercialInfo  |
| clientID              |
| clientImmutables      |
| clientMutables        |
| serviceInfo           |
+-----------------------+

The second step is generate random information from text files containing
first names, second names, street names in NYC, as well as 
random subscriptions to the services that upc-cablecom is currently offering.



The third step is to analyze the data base looking for information that may be 
intresting for upc-cablecom.

//////WHAT THE CODE NEEEDS/////

1) a running instance of MYSQL server
2)python 2.7
3)MySQLdb
4) a database called toydatabase
5) on a mysql session, run USE toydatabase
6)see below


//////HOW THE CODE WORKS///////

1. The code uses a connection from python to a MYSQL server.
One only needs to update the information on line 6 in
getConnectionToDB.py

"con = mdb.connect('localhost', 'root', '123123123', 'toydatabase',charset='utf8');"

where root is the user and '123123123' is the password.


2. create and fill the database with random information:

python createRandomInfo.py

    2.1the first step is to check if the tables exist, if they do, it drops the tables
    and creates them again via createDataBase_upc.py. On the first run, this will
    produce some warnings.

    2.2 fills the databases with random information.

subsequent calls to createRandomInfo.py will drop existing tables if present and
re-create them again.

3. Analyze the database with some simple SQL queries.

python analyzeDB.py

For example, the last query finds what the average revenue is for those users who have a combi
subscription and are younger than 40 years old.
